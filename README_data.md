Background
===============================================================================
Access time generally describes the time associated with the establishment of a talk pathupon user request to speak and has been identified as a key component of Quality of Experience (QoE) in communications. NISTâ€™s Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) division developed a method to measure and quantify the access time of any Push To Talk (PTT) communication system. PSCR presents a broad definition of access time that is applicable across multiple PTT technologies. The measurement system builds off of the following definitions: 
* **End-to-end access time** is the total amount of time from when a transmitting user first presses PTT until a receiving user hears intelligible audio. It consists of two components: mouth-to-ear latency and access delay.
* **Mouth-to-ear latency** characterizes the time between speech being input into one device and its output through another.
* **Access delay** is minimum length of time a user must wait between pressing a PTT button and starting to speak to ensure that the start of the message is not lost.

A speech intelligibility-based access delay measurement system is introduced.  This system measures the intelligibility of a target word based on when PTT was pushed within a pre-defined message.  It relies only on speech going into and coming out of a voice communications system and PTT timing, so it functions as a fair platform to compare different technologies.  Example measurements were performed across the following Land Mobile Radio (LMR) technologies:  analog direct and conventional modes,and digital Project 25 (P25) direct and trunked (both phase 1 and phase 2) modes.

This data was created in support of NISTIR 8275, Mission Critical Voice QoE Access Time Measurement Methods, available free of charge from https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8275

Structure of the Data
===============================================================================
The data is stored with the following structure:
- **Audio Clips**
  - Folder containing audio files used in measurement
  - Audio files are stored as wav files
  - Cut point files are associated with each audio file. These detail at which sample the first playthrough of the word under test,P1, and and the second playthrough, P2, start. The sampling rate for the audio files is 48 KHz.
- **Measurements** 
  - Folder containing folders for each example measurement performed.
  - Each subfolder has four csv files, one for each speaker word pair used for the testing.
  - CSV files have the following structure:
    - AudioFiles = 'path/to/audiofilename.wav'
    - fs = 48000
    - HEADER: PTT_time,PTT_start,ptt_st_dly,P1_Int,P2_Int,m2e_latency,underRun,overRun
    - Data
